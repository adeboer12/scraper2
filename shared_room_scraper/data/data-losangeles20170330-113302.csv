The room is available for a short term in the range of 30-90 days.  A longer stay may be possible but can't be guaranteed at this time.  Given the short duration, our hope is find someone with only minimal belongings. 

About us: The household is currently shared among all adults ranging in age from 33 to 50. The gender mix is predominately female. 

Collectively, we are best described as a pet-centric and sustainably-focused. Meticulously clean and strong need for order and structure in household. We may have a friend or two over for dinner or a movie but do not have parties in the house. We usually wake between 630am -- 9am and go to sleep between 11pm -- 1am. Our values range from moderate to conservative. 3 small dogs plus a very chill cat also reside at the house. 

About you: A positive, team-oriented attitude is a necessity. Detail oriented is also a big plus. Non-smokers only. No drug usage of any kind allowed. Must have a stable source of income. Background check may be required. A motivated self-starter and a meticulous sense of cleanliness are also absolute requirements. We wish to avoid types that require micro-management and/or constant instruction. 

Most importantly, we are seeking someone who is ""pet conscientious"". This means you have a comfortability, familiarity, and awareness with animals that goes beyond simply ""pet tolerant"". For example, if you see something that seems out of the ordinary, you possess the initiative to investigate or alert someone. Also, since our pets are an interactive part of the household, you're nature is inclined to be welcoming should they seek your attention.

Car free is desireable. If you will be without a car, then please mention. 

Given this room has a shared bath with two other females, this posting is female preferred. 

Also, drinking in moderation is fine but no drunken inebriation is allowed in the home. 

Please note personality compatibility is a must so we are looking for the most ideal fit and not necessarily the most immediate fit. 

To help us with the screening process, please tell us something about yourself and your personality, your typical living habits, and your desired living situation. A pic or head shot is also highly recommended. Again, if you don't have a car, please let us know as this may improve your chances for consideration.

Note, if you do not provide us any info about yourself, then we do our initial assessment based upon what we can find on the internet (google, facebook, etc.). If you have a common name or generic email address, we may not be able to do any assessment as we cannot locate anything about you on the internet.

Sadly, people create mask to meet them ask of others. Then we wonder why we cannot love, feel, connect. how much do you know someone? Besides the discussions of current events, and mainstream information. How much do you know the people in your life? it Can be hard to be authentic, because we've been taught how to behave, look, act, ad be around people, We've put so much emphasis on being ""approved"" and ""accepted"" by others more than who we really are. We talk about our statues and what we're up to, but we don't share our true self. We don't share what we feel. We don't openly expose our thoughts. We Bottle it in, because we hope that we'll be accepted for what we present, not who we are. we ask each other ""how are you"" and its always the generic answer ""good!"" The Reply becomes automatic, because we haven't learned how to be authentic with our true self. 
Everything Starts with you:
The first step is learning to accept yourself. This requires putting emphasis on what you think about yourself, more than what others think. Its learning to love yourself by being raw, open, and honest with who you are. Once you feel comfortable with yourself, you can be open and honest with the other person.

One must be smart, well-spoken and possess ""good social skills"". At this company, we DO NOT say ""awesome"" or ""cool""! In other words, you must be able to talk in an articulate coherent manner.

My roommate and I are losing two wonderful roommates, and their bedroom is available. We are 2 males late 20's, early 30's who just recently just moved here from out of state. We both work odd hours and a lot of times we are rarely home. The days we do spend at home are usually working from the house. We both enjoy hanging out with friends rather than having parties, but occasionally go out. We are both pretty quiet and keep to ourselves most of the times when home. We do have a couple big dogs that are trained and well behaved as well. Please tell us a little bit about yourself or even include a social media link! We're meeting with potential people starting this week.

Room is $800 with utilities included.
A $500 security deposit is required.

I'm looking to fill a bedroom in my large 2nd floor, 2BR/2BA apartment. 

Features:
- Your own private full bathroom! Just outside your room in the hallway.
- High ceilings in the living room (tons of natural light)
- Full, modern kitchen
- Balcony (great place to sun with a great view of the street)
- Secure garage parking below building (street as well)

I really can't emphasize enough how walkable this neighborhood is.  We're close pretty much everything, including:

- Two walkable blocks from the shops, restaurants, Arclight theater and nightlife of Downtown Culver City
- Large shopping center just around the corner, including Sprouts, In-N-Out Burger, CVS, Starbucks, Ross, WingStop, Togo's, etc.
- Three walkable blocks from the Expo line metro-rail station.
- Access to the 10 freeway is just around the corner

Also it's a great central location in the city! Short drive to Venice, Beverly Hills, West Hollywood, etc.

Also a great deal, considering the average rents in the area are much higher.

About me: Early 30's straight male professional, working in entertainment. I'm pretty relaxed and spend most of my time working, so I'd love to find someone relatively quiet and like-minded! Sociability is great and I'm all for kicking back with a few drinks from time to time...just not looking for someone who likes to bring the party / frequent guests home. 

Lease is currently month to month, but you'd be added to the lease officially. Looking for someone who can stay for at least a while (not looking for a short-term subletter).

Available May 1st!
 
Anyway - if you're looking, drop me a line and let's talk!

We are picky who lives here, so if your interested please tell us as much as you can about you, send links to sites or social media, your age and your music or what you do.

Who we are:
We are a group of entertainment professionals, entrepreneurs, inventors and artists who are all very creative and inspired. Some of us travel frequently and some of us are currently out of town, so we have some temporary space and love meeting new people and making new friends. We all work in film, photography, web development, music , and a wide variety of other creative fields. We all love what we do and value each others different skill sets and abilities.
We all respect each others differences and value a no drama creative lifestyle were everyone is supportive and inspires the best in people.
We all work hard and love to play and enjoy life in our free time! We love to share and network with each other. We are very easy going and not into a heavy party / drugs lifestyle, but love gatherings and inspiring interactions . We work hard and do our best to also have some fun. . .
We also have a 4 time Grammy winning recording engineer on site and a recording studio space with vocal isolation booth and great mic's and gear , so if you need to do some recording or some advice , so this might be an Ideal add on feature for a talented,positive, inspired, low ego, collaborative individual who fits to our group and personality.

The area:
Since we moved here ( just recently!) we discovered 3 great Thai restaurants within walking distance, 2 all you can eat Persian food buffets which are amazing, many more international restaurants we have not tried yet , many kosher deli's and crazy good PHO places and a vegetarian chinese restaurant all withing walking distance. . ..and we also discovered that the local Subway is open 24 hours and that we have a drive-in starbucks which opens at 4:30am just 1 block away . . ..and we also have way to many fast food/ restaurants and 7/11's right within just a couple blocks of our beautiful campground kind of haven ! Also, a big bonus, we live half a block from the very dried up LA river and Reseda park and rec center where you can find ducks and awesome late night Taco trucks and for those who fear, we live 2 blocks away from police station , we are also only 8 minutes away from Balboa park, the Archery range, 2 golf courses, basket ball and tennis courts and all the more upscale stuff Encino ,Tarzana and Northridge has to offer we also have the metro link right down a couple blocks where you can hop on the train and end up in NoHo / studio city in no time. . .. Many of us moved here from Santa Monica and never realized how much more cool stuff there is and how many good places there are to shop and eat . . ..
So while Reseda does not count to the ""top places to live"" in most peoples books, check out the local crime rates and compare them to Santa Monica, and then consider relaxing in the middle of everything in your nature retreat with huge trees and fun people and a good creative vibe.

In case your interested to check out the place, please send us as much info about yourself as possible so we don't waste each others time.

The place is located in Riverside Rancho area, which is the NW border of Burbank/Glendale. It is near the Media Center District, AT&T/Warner Bros, Dreamworks, Disney Accelerator Program, Walt Disney Studios, Disney Imagineering, ABC, Comcast NBC Universal, and a dash into Hollywood or downtown LA. Also most all of the Major Record Labels are 10 mins away.  The place is also near the 5 and 134 freeway. It's within walking distance of Griffith Park, LA Zoo and the Equestrian Center, and lots of shopping. Storage for a bicycle if needed.

The room is for one person. The rent is $825per month, plus a security deposit of $825. 

First months rent in advance with deposit, and due on the 1st of each month (will prorate 1st months rent).The term of the sub-lease is month-to-month, 3 months minimum stay, with lease agreement. 

Looking for a very peaceful and kind person who is employed and stable to rent a nicely FURNISHED room in a town house that I lease. 

Male or female are welcome. No pets please. Not a place to run a business out of... employed means you have a job outside the home, where you GO to work. 

Please be able to prove your employment history, financial stability, with canceled checks and verifiable work references (not friends), or we can do a credit check, your option. Application required prior to being accepted. This is NOT a room and board situatio, and as such: please buy, cook and eat your own food, same is true with toiletries, etc. 

You're a responsible person and clean up after yourself, and help keep the house clean. If you will not clean up, then you would be asscessed a cleaning fee of $50 for the month for maid service to do it for you. Need to have your own car or other form of transportation.

I've lived here 15 years, and this is one of the best and safest places in all of LA or the SF Valley to live; for the money you can't afford much better. 

During the day I use the front of the house as my office area, but you can enjoy it in the evening and weekends. There is plenty of street parking, and sadly that is all that is available.

GENERAL NEIGHBORHOOD: This is a very quiet and safe tree lined street with speed bumps and 15 mph speed signs installed. The house is a few minutes away from things such as Griffith Park, The LA County Zoo. By the way, the Disney employee tram stops 1/2 block from here,

Located just blocks (less than 2 miles) from: the social, dinning and shopping center hubs of Burbank Media Center, The Americana, and the Glendale Galleria. Located minutes from the L.A. Olympic Equestrian Center (best horseback riding center in L.A.), several great parks and picnic areas. Also nearby the Griffith Observatory, 5 golf courses, miles and miles of mountain hiking and biking trials, and the Burbank Pickquick Bowling Alley and Ice Skating Rink are just moments away.

DRIVING LOCATION: The place is located just West of the 5 frwy @ in between Western or Alameda exits, and North of the 134 frwy. @ Victory exit.

with any questions you may have, or if you want to schedule a time to come by and check the place out. I have a few basic questions I ask to see if we can get along, if you don't mind. You can do the same.

We are picky who lives here, so if your interested please tell us as much as you can about you, send links to sites or social media, your age and your music or what you do.

Who we are:
We are a group of entertainment professionals, entrepreneurs, inventors and artists who are all very creative and inspired. Some of us travel frequently and some of us are currently out of town, so we have some temporary space and love meeting new people and making new friends. We all work in film, photography, web development, music , and a wide variety of other creative fields. We all love what we do and value each others different skill sets and abilities.
We all respect each others differences and value a no drama creative lifestyle were everyone is supportive and inspires the best in people.
We all work hard and love to play and enjoy life in our free time! We love to share and network with each other. We are very easy going and not into a heavy party / drugs lifestyle, but love gatherings and inspiring interactions . We work hard and do our best to also have some fun. . .
We also have a 4 time Grammy winning recording engineer on site and a recording studio space with vocal isolation booth and great mic's and gear , so if you need to do some recording or some advice , so this might be an Ideal add on feature for a talented,positive, inspired, low ego, collaborative individual who fits to our group and personality.

About our space:
Our space is wired with super High Speed Internet (300 Mbps)

Utilities are included with High speed internet and best of all, when renting with us you have access to our ""Open Kitchen"" where you usually can find some mostly organic veggies and fruits and all the basic staple foods like Rice, pancake / waffle mix , awesome spices and asian food supplies and tons of canned items which are included in your rent because we like to share our food.

The area:
Since we moved here ( just recently!) we discovered 3 great Thai restaurants within walking distance, 2 all you can eat Persian food buffets which are amazing, many more international restaurants we have not tried yet , many kosher deli's and crazy good PHO places and a vegetarian chinese restaurant all withing walking distance. . ..and we also discovered that the local Subway is open 24 hours and that we have a drive-in starbucks which opens at 4:30am just 1 block away . . ..and we also have way to many fast food/ restaurants and 7/11's right within just a couple blocks of our beautiful campground kind of haven ! Also, a big bonus, we live half a block from the very dried up LA river and Reseda park and rec center where you can find ducks and awesome late night Taco trucks and for those who fear, we live 2 blocks away from police station , we are also only 8 minutes away from Balboa park, the Archery range, 2 golf courses, basket ball and tennis courts and all the more upscale stuff Encino ,Tarzana and Northridge has to offer we also have the metro link right down a couple blocks where you can hop on the train and end up in NoHo / studio city in no time. . .. Many of us moved here from Santa Monica and never realized how much more cool stuff there is and how many good places there are to shop and eat . . ..
So while Reseda does not count to the ""top places to live"" in most peoples books, check out the local crime rates and compare them to Santa Monica, and then consider relaxing in the middle of everything in your nature retreat with huge trees and fun people and a good creative vibe.

In case your interested to check out the place, please send us as much info about yourself as possible so we don't waste each others time.
Resumes, Bios , social media accounts etc etc are all good ways to give us a better idea as to who you are. . ...and just for FYI, most likely your personality, work and dreams you dedicate yourself to is more important to us than your credit score, however, please be responsible and prompt on the rent and with everyone and everything in this space and most of all, please be an awesome human whos company we can all enjoy.
So if this sounds like you might love it, please let us know. We are looking for some cool room mates for a month to month until we really know that we all are a good more permanent match.


Ideal tenant:
We hope to rent to someone who is happy and has a life and dreams and inspirations and has a positive outlook on things .
You should also be someone who values hard work, trust, other people and a great vibe and who is capable to focus more on what brings us together as human beings instead of what divides us.

Some other perks :
Yes, sure, We are picky about who lives here , but once you do live here you will be ""part of the family"" and have access to our combined skills, knowledge and many of our combined assets, tools and toys
Some of what we have onsite:
16ft. flat bed trailer, Sailboat, small enclosed trailer, Table saw, air-compressor, welder, wood working shed, a wide variety of general wood and car mechanic tools etc
once we know you and based on trust, you will also have access to our ( coming soon!) onsite converted garage Music Studio with vocal booth, film production,editing and photography equipment, lights and backdrops and of site reduced fee film/photo/ music studio access etc in Noho and Santa Monica.

My name is Shawn and I am an actor that auditions a lot, I also build websites and work part-time jobs to keep steady. 

My current roommate isn't a clean person and smells, so I am looking to replace him. My lease ends in August and I am looking for the right person who would like to stay until then. This will offer you a stable place to live. 

I am peaceful, a multitasker, love to make new friends and a gym rat. 

My idea roommate is someone who's busy trying to make something out of themselves. Someone who works hard for what they want and not going to be a couch potato with a bad attitude. Basically, someone who isn't going to be home all the time. Your goal should be to get ahead and make as much money as possible. 

I AM ASKING FOR 675 PLUS A 100 KEY DEPOSIT MOVES YOU IN (GET KEY DEPOSIT BACK WHEN YOU MOVE OUT). SO A TOTAL OF $775.00.

Professional, mature female (early 40's, but very young at heart) searching for a house to share/private room to rent with another female, in a dog loving household. I have a 12-year-old (will be 13 in June) senior dog who is a medium/tall-ish sized American Staffordshire/Lab mix, and he is my world.

About me:
I am a UCLA Graduate and professional who has a secure, full-time job (M-F 8am - 5pm). I am super clean and neat, fairly quiet, very respectful and courteous, and very responsible. I am honest, chill, pretty laid-back and easy going. I pay my rent and bills on time. I am an animal lover and former rescuer/volunteer. I am looking for the same in a roommate. My passion is baking, so you must be ok with that. I also love to cook healthy and be healthy in general. 

About my kid (dog):
Yes, he is my 12 year old child. I rescued him at 4 months old and he has been with me ever since. He is an old man who would rather sleep all day than do anything else. He is 100% house trained, well mannered, fixed, and up to date on all shots. He loves all dogs and humans (small or big). He thinks he's a lap dog. He doesn't have many more years, so I spoil him as much as possible.

I need to be as close to the Metro Gold Line as possible (heading to Union Station). So, I am looking for a place near Azusa Pacific University, Citrus College, Azusa, Glendora, possibly Irwindale or Northern Covina. Just as long as I am near the Gold Line. I will be ready to move in mid-April.

Rent is negotiable, depending upon utilities. I would prefer a month-to-month basis and not a huge deposit that will break the bank.

My name is Shawn and I am an actor that auditions a lot, I also build websites and work part-time jobs to keep steady.

I am peaceful, a multitasker, love to make new friends and a gym rat. 

My idea roommate is someone who's busy trying to make something out of themselves. Someone who works hard for what they want and not going to be a couch potato with a bad attitude. Basically, someone who isn't going to be home all the time. Your goal should be to get ahead and make as much money as possible. 

I AM ASKING FOR 675 PLUS A 100 KEY DEPOSIT MOVES YOU IN (GET KEY DEPOSIT BACK WHEN YOU MOVE OUT). SO A TOTAL OF $775.00.
