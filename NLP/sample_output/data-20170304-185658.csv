Everyone in the house is extremely passionate and devoted to what they do and this is what sets our house apart from any other living situation.

You could pay to crash in a room all by yourself/with a close buddy, or you could stay and effortlessly make friends that will last.

roommates will probably try to recruit you to work at startups and such so if that's your thing (it's not mine haha) living here could also be a great networking opportunity.

With respect to the logistics of accommodations things got a lot better. There is a ""house CEO"" to make sure absolutely everything is working and running smoothly. You likely to find comfort in knowing that if there is anything that needed to be addressed, there was someone whose job is to make sure this happens asap. This also epitomizes the entire culture of the house.
