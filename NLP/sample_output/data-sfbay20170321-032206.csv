There are two pools, a small gym, and card-pay laundry, and parking is on-street. Your room is private, the bathroom, kitchen, and balcony are shared. The rest of the pad is my area. There's a nice couch in your room so you can set-up an entertainment center in there.\n-Hi-Speed Wi-Fi, Water, Gas, Garbage, are ALL INCLUDED. Purchase cable TV if you wish. \n-2 blocks from BART, 2 blocks from Safeway, Lucky, Chevron, Starbucks, BofA, Wells Fargo, Chase,Walgreens, CVS, Chipolte, Mexican/Chinese/Italian/Thai/Sushi restaurants, and a Post Office. On-ramps to Highways 580/238 are about 2-minutes drive time.\n-I am looking for one person (single occupancy only) and leaning toward a female (as that seems a better fit for me), 25 and up, perhaps a nursing student, a professional, or similar non-partying mature, CLEAN, and responsible adult, who will pay her rent on time. We will respect each other's space and be quite friendly and cordial, yet will not get into each other's business. \n-Zero Drugs, Zero Drama, Zero Drunks, Zero Pets, and a non-smoker is preferred (but if you smoke then on the balcony only not in the room or elsewhere inside okay).\n-Typical rules apply (i.e. No overly loud music or TV, quiet times are 08:00am to 10:00pm (okay, 11:00pm on Fri/Sat), no cooking/smoking in the room, no Drama, and please love my two little doggies.\n-Did I mention I have two little doggies?  Both are friendly and nice. (GET THIS: $25.00 off the monthly fee if you let them out to their balcony 'pee area' a few times a night while I am away or working! Otherwise they get crated which I and they don't like. That $25 off would include an occasional prearranged feeding on those rare times when I am away for extended hours, 1 or 2x a month).\n-About me: I am a 55 year old professional male, respectful, clean, and easy to get along with, and not a jerk (usually).\n-NOTE: Sorry but no guests. I've had nasty experiences with coming home to strangers roaming about, casing the place, drinking it up, leaving messes, and doing the 'Bim Bam' at 04:00am. Sorry, but no can do. (I'm flexible tho, so on the rare day your sister is in town from Alaska to visit, or an old friend calls then BY PRE-ARRANGEMENT ONLY we can make the rare occasional exception.) I simply do not want to come home to strangers in the pad. Again, sorry. \nPLEASE EMAIL ME WITH SOME INFO ABOUT YOURSELF AND WHY YOU THINK YOU WOULD MAKE A GOOD FIT. PLEASE NOTE, A CREDIT CHECK IS REQUIRED AS ARE REFERENCES (PARTICULARLY PRIOR LANDLORDS).\nThanks and good hunting!""",True,TRUE,TRUE,False,True,TRUE,True,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE
