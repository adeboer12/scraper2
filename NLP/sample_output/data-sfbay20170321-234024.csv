Its a house thats been converted into a 2 seperate apts. Im on the ground floor with 2 bdrms, bathroom, kitchen, living room etc. The rent is 900 a mo. The utilities will be included (water,pg&e, garbadge) I only have internet in my room so if you want it it would have to come out of your own pocket (sorry). I also don't have a house phone as well. I have a washer/dryer that I bought and I'd  be willing to share and work out some kind of washing sched with you. You will have off street parking. No visitor parking though street prkg is kinda sucky. The prking in the back is super small and for the tenants only. Sorry no sleep overs of any kind, visiting is fine as long as theres prior notice pls. You will have kitchen privileges and I have a fridge that I can make room for your groceries. Out of courtesy for my neighbors and its also apt policy as well, no loud noise after 10. I have a couple and a 3yr old that live above me. They are rarely home so its fairly quiet... \n\nWhat Im looking for...\nFemale preferred, sorry guys no offense. Pls have a job,be able to show proof of income.\nAt least a 30 day notice to vacate if after your not feeling it will work for you.\nWould love it if you didn't smoke, but if you do it has to be off the property  (like literally across the street)(brokers rules not mine)\nSorry no pets of any kind. (Brokers rules)\nBe clean. I mean no one is perfect but hey strive to be tidy so I'm not cleaning up after you.\nNo party girls pls. Im not super loud or have loads of ppl come over. What you do outside of the house off the property is your business. \nBeing a people person is a nice plus, because I am :o) I will do a meet and greet away from the house first just to be formal to see if theres good vibes. And would like it if my g/f can accompany me.\n\nA bit about me....\nSo first off, out the gate, I am a lesbian and yes I  have a g/f. She doesn't live with me but she will come over every once in a while. If you are cool with this and like minded,awesome, if you aren't but won't  have a prob living with a les ok, cool and I have respect for everyone's choices, as I hope you will too.  Im 36, I  have my own car and I work crazy hours. Im super friendly, virgo need I say more. I do enjoy a little drink every now and again but you will never see me crawling the floor drunk :o) I'm mostly a home body. I just moved into this house about 6 months ago soooo I have boxes and stuff in places that I'm trying to clear up and out of the way. If I've left anything out or you have questions pls feel free to ask. ;o)\nThe tie breaker.....\nSoooo ultimately I'm not trying to be here long, my g/f and I are planning on moving to Oregon in about 6 to 7 months (god willing) give or take and if things work out with you and I, I can try and transfer the apt into your name when I get ready to leave. Or I can just give you a heads up b4 I get ready to leave so you can start looking and do your own thing. All in all, having someone help with the rent would be awesome,So I can save for my big move. Some of the things I've said can be negotiable within time. Pls. Just bear with me as this will be my first time renting out this room to a stranger... thanks again for reading all my babble and happy hunting! \xf0\x9f\x98\x86""",False,TRUE,FALSE,True,True,TRUE,True,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE
