 About the Flat:
- Huge 5 bedroom 2bath (with a living room!), in the 2nd floor of a 112 year old Victorian mansion 
- 12 ft ceilings and unique common-area skylights with lots of natural light
- Solar panels on the roof mean we have no electric bill. 
- Incredible location in the heart of the Mission, close to 24th street bart station
- Newly remodeled kitchen (with a dishwasher)
- On-site Laundry (not coin-operated)
 
About you: 

You're mature (can't stress this enough), have a good job (with verifiable steady income), enjoy going out but rarely bring the party home. We all work quite a bit and tend to keep things mellow when we're home, so you should be the same way. Most importantly, you are considerate, clean up after yourself, and pitch in with cleaning/dishes without needing to be asked (we have a wonderful cleaning person who cleans the apartment once or twice a month, which is included in the rent). 

The rooms: 
Room 1: 
$1500
The larger of the two, fits a queen bed, desk, dresser, a clothes rack and couch with room to spare
Western-facing window, lots of light after noon
Note: no closet

Room 2: 
$1450
Smaller of the two rooms, plenty of room for a Queen bed, dresser, and desk, with a good sized closet
Southern-facing window that gets plenty of light throughout the day

About us:  

Guy 1: 29, From Chicago, works in tech but not a tech bro. 
Loves travel, playing piano, coffee, hanging out in Dolores Park, and going to shows - Pitchfork this summer.

  Girl 1: 29, From Australia, designer at Apple
Into baking, travel, live music, exploring the city, and sour beers

Girl 2: 27, from the east coast, works in marketing, 
Enjoys urban hiking, writing, and reading a good book

  As mentioned, we work a lot and generally keep things pretty laid back and quiet - especially during the week. We rarely have parties, and are looking for someone that's looking for a respectful, easygoing living situation. Despite being a house of five people, we aren't looking for a commune-style living arrangement - everyone tends to keep to themselves at home, with no social obligations, house dinners, etc here - introverts welcome. 

  If you're interested, respond by telling us about yourself - your age, where you're from, what you do for fun, etc, and include a FB or LI link. Please put your favorite musician/band in the subject line so we know you read the whole ad. We'll follow up if we think you're a good candidate, and can schedule viewings as early as Sunday night (3/6).

We need a roommate!

We have a medium-sized room for a good price! We hope to find someone to fill it April 1st.

OK first things first. You need to have a good credit score. No pets. No couples! Just want to get that out of the way so we dont waste each others' time here.

We are at the intersection of 20th and Noriega. Pretty quiet. Lots of transit options, even late at night:
28-1 block 
7-2 blocks 
n- 4 blocks (loooooooong boring sunset blocks ohhh my!) 
6- 5 blocks 
91, n owl, l owl- all between 1 and 6 blocks

5 blocks to Golden Gate Park.

The room is fairly large with it's own medium sized closet. It has 2 decent sized windows looking out on the backyard. Kitchen, dining room, large living room, w/d and kind of crappy, but grill-worthy backyard all at your disposal.

Teja (32ish)lives upstairs in the teensy-weentsy room that's olive green so by default she is not home much. She is a doctor in Palo Alto and is almost never here. It's a matter of a few days a month. She basically uses the room as a storage closet. I honestly haven't seen her in more than 4 months. She is really smart and friendly when you do see her.

Dylan is 29. He is a lighting tech who travels for his job occasionally. Great sense of humor. He loves everything bicycle and has about half a dozen bikes in the basement.

These are the people who live upstairs that you will share a bathroom with.

My name is Greg (34). I live downstairs. I have my own bathroom. I will travel a lot for my job this summer. When I am not working on that job, I play music, bicycle, ski and do some volunteer work. 

Bills will need to be divided by 4. Gas, water, internet, electricity... .

If you are the chosen one, this house is as much yours as ours from day one and we want you to feel that way.

We want someone who will help clean occasionally, but if you are a neat-freak its not gonna work. Selfish slob will not work either... We are really easy going and generally flexible. We would like to get a monthly cleaning service going for the common areas.

Oh please be fun and reasonable and trustworthy and jobbed.

Teja hopes you are a girl but will try to love you either way. I don't want to know in advance (but there had better not be 2 of you!).

If you are interested write me back and tell us a little about yourself. Prove you are a real human being who read this ad.

I can meet potential roommates at various times this week or weekend

A little more about our interests and what we're looking for in a roommate:

Living in the city definitely has its advantages. Being able to live in the city is a privilege given the insane rent prices, so a lot of us don't waste our time. We are food-lovers, beer-lovers, dancers, party-ers, but also enjoy hanging out and watching Game of Thrones. A lot of us are into the tech/startup community so we'll try to organize some Tech talks and programming events. We have non-tech events as well - we go out together to explore nature in the SF/Bay Area and play on local amateur sports teams. We also host epic parties!

For a roommate, we are looking for anyone friendly, easy going, have some common interest stated above, clean, respectful and most of all, enjoy living in an awesome city like San Francisco!

I am looking for a female roommate because the lady I am sharing a room with currently might be moving out. It seriously sucks and it makes me sad because she's really cool, funny, open minded, 420 friendly, has a good sense of humor and has sarcasm. She has a friend who needs  place and unfortunately she might go with her to help with the cost of rent and  I don't know what else. 

The rent amount will be 370 plus abut 20 bucks in bills, we have wifi, Netflix, cable, and you can use our cooking stuff if you aren't super picky. We all clean one day out of the week, at least just the bathroom, you don't have to clean the living room or kitchen. 
We don't have a parking lot to offer you unfortunately, I am 25 years old, a guy, very open minded, chill, respectful, sarcastic, have a great sense of humor, and I'll love to share the room with a lady who has some of the same characteristics. I'm single, work in retail at Nordstrom, I am not just looking for a roommate more like someone I can be great friends with if that's possible. I don't want to share the room with someone that is serious, gets mad easily, or doesn't like sarcasm. We are Latinos too by the way. We can meet for a drink in a public place and see if we are compatible to share a space. I'll update this depending on what my current roommate decides to do, I do hope she stays but if she can't then as much as it sucks I need to find someone else.",TRUE,TRUE,False,True,FALSE,True,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE

I've got a nice, sunny room available for immediate occupancy for an easy going (not uptight) guy who is clean, and a non-smoker

It's month to month, so you aren't locked into anything long term.

It's a good home ...relaxed, drama-free, safe, clean, and visitor-friendly.  I do prefer someone who is sociable (not reclusive or creepy), but of course we all need our private time.


PERKS:

*Reserved Parking Space at our doorstep

*Washer & Dryer In-Unit

*Fast / Reliable WiFi

*Swimming Pool

*Patio w/storage room

*Quiet / Peaceful Complex

*Near BART

*Five minutes to freeway


THE ROOM:  Unfurnished, just painted, sunny, cable-ready, good size closet

THE HOME:  2BR / 1.5BA townhouse ... comfortable, clean, no funk, no dirty dishes left out anywhere. Fireplace, patio, new faucets, nice (new) shower head, spacious fridge, very cold freezer, dining table seats six, DirecTV, WiFi

Dealbreakers:

* Non-smoker ONLY (Sorry, not a fan of smoke of any kind ... no tobacco / no pot)

* NON-gamer (Lived with a gamer, and discovered that the rumbling noise is obnoxious and annoying if you don't play)

* Seeking a guy who works outside the home (that's primarily because I work from home myself)

------------------------------

AVAILABLE: Now (Exact move-in date is flexible ...any date between now and April 1st) - Rent will be prorated

TERM:  Month-to-Month (Sub-Tenant)

RENT:  $700 / month (water included)

UTILITIES:  Split equally 50/50


You'll have only one housemate (a male). Well-rounded individual. Enjoy Netflix (especially documentaries), beer & wine, whiskey & coke, good food, travel, dogs, reading, writing, interesting people, a history buff, good sense of humor, and not a bad cook, and I do enjoy cooking for others, and open to having casual dinners with friends

Sorry ...No pets, children, or ""live-in"" girlfriend (not seeking a 3rd roommate, but an occasional overnight guest OK)


THE IDEAL ROOMMATE ...

... a guy who is drama-free, open minded (not uptight), not bothered by random vulgar language and adult fun. Must help keep the place clean (it does suck not having maid service). No funk or dirty dishes allowed (not a fan of rodents).  Having a ""go with the flow"" attitude helps.

Send email if this sounds like a good match.

Please briefly introduce yourself, and provide some basic info about you (work schedule, interests, targeted move-in date, etc.) 
Cannot respond to vague emails. Thanks.

PS - If you have any ""unusual"" hobbies or lifestyles, please be upfront.  I don't want to find out after you move-in, that you chant at 5:00 am, never shower, practice witchcraft, or play the tuba :)",TRUE,FALSE,True,True,TRUE,True,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE

I have available a  room with a twin bed in the spacious and modern 2 bedroom, 1.5 bath townhouse apartment in Larkfield, northeast Santa Rosa, CA, (just south of Windsor) .

It is very quiet, clean, peaceful, safe here, and in a safe neighborhood, freeway 101-close. This is in the heart of the beautiful Sonoma County wine country, yet does not leave the city of Santa Rosa too far behind (5 exits to downtown).

There is no garage here or storage lockers, this would have to be for someone travelin' light, and/or having a storage unit or stuff stored elsewhere (that wouldn't fit in the room's closet).

I'm sorry, unfortunately no pets are allowed as I already have two cats and no further pets are allowed here.

I am a female seeking either a male or female housemate. Rent is $640/month which includes utilities (excluding telephone), and wi-fi, kitchen use (all modern appliances) and your own designated fridge and generous allotted cupboard shelf space for dry goods. 

, single occupancy, not conducive for couples, or someone with a child(ren). 

I am seeking a room renter who is friendly, neat, clean, tidy, picks up after themselves, and knows the value of keeping common areas clean, and being respectful of others' space and possessions. 

Am seeking someone who is a  and non-drug user only, no alcohol abusers, i.e., nightly heavy drinking, no convicted felons.  

This is for someone with an operative vehicle only, and not depending on public transportation and/or a bicycle, or people to pick them off and drop them off.

If any possible future interest do send me an introductory e-mail note and tell me a little about yourself, what you are seeking, if it's temporary, short-term, or indefinite-ongoing because of your job here. 

No lease (month-to-month), just a mutually-signed agreement stating monies received with a $100 refundable deposit returned upon departure (to which I give a receipt). I find the best match what I am seeking is someone who works full-time (days) outside the house---sorry not conducive for folks working p.m. swing-shifts or graveyard shifts and thus sleeping days, and/or working out of the home.

What is Le Chateau McMansion?


At the end of the day, after everyone has gotten home from work, and we've shared good food and good stories with the people we find ourselves surrounded by, we are a family. It means we care for each other, for each other's things, and for the home we've created. It means spontaneous trips to National Parks, creative and fun house projects, and weekends you wish would never end. Sometimes it is kitchen dance parties, rooftop lemon golf, costumed 7-course dinners, farmers market trips by bike, homebrew beer contests, or chill weekends of grilling and gardening balanced by late-night deep philosophical debates. Without a doubt, it is a place to experience learning and growth, friendship, adventures, acceptance, and awesomeness in our home. We are more than roommates. We are community.


Who lives at McMansion?


A French roboticist, a talented couple from Texas whose music will pluck on your heartstrings, a spunky dude from the dark corners of Tennessee, a sweetheart from Boston, a community organizer from Chicago, a French Stanford lab researcher, a Canadian and a German techie, and a couple of native Californians... each with a hand in the tech industry, rock climbing, and a passion for cycling.


Where is McMansion?


McMansion is located in Redwood City, which is about halfway between San Jose and San Francisco. With the constant bustle of San Francisco, the Sierra Nevada mountains in our back yard, and the convenient proximity to Palo Alto.. Le Chateau McMansion has an endless supply of new experiences and exciting escapades. The CalTrain is a quick 10-minute bike ride from the house. Accompanied by the 3-minute drive to highway 280, this house is ideal for young professionals and students alike. We've had great experiences with international students who have lived at the house and were able to bike or ride the train to Stanford in about 30 minutes. With a car, the commute is cut in half.


How much is my rent?


Each community member pays $1210/mo which breaks down like this:
$875 rent
$335 community fees*




WTF are community fees?


*Community fees are the lifeblood of Le Chateau McMansion. Your community fees cover what you would expect: utilities including water, gas, and electric, garbage pickup, facilities costs, project funds, and get this.. It covers your groceries. That is, OUR groceries. But you get to go shopping with us! Or add it to the community grocery list and we'll get it for you.




What does living at the McMansion look like?


All rooms are shared and come furnished.
Ample common spaces, a pool and sauna, a large beautiful kitchen
All-included utilities
Month-to-month lease
An awesome garden and chickens who lay fresh eggs!
Shared food plan** (one of the most popular aspects of the community)


**The shared food plan was developed as an experiment in pooling our money to buy common groceries, using economies of scale and connections to buy more delicious food for less, sharing to prevent food waste, and reduce difficulties of coordinating food between roommates. It is pretty awesome.




Who are we looking for?


We love adding awesome people to our community. We especially love people who share some of our values like respect, gratitude, personal responsibility, open-mindedness, adventures, growth, glitter and awesomeness. Our living situation is compatible with short-term or long-term stays, both students and professionals. Are you an outside-the-box thinker? Looking for something a little different but definitely awesome? Are you a social butterfly or an interested introvert seeking to explore new things? Do you like to hack the system or prefer to do-it-yourself? Are you a maker, artist, doer, problem solver?

We are looking a new female housemate to join us in our home in March.

The room is compact (9' x 6'), but comes with it's own ensuite bathroom, two closets, hardwood floors and windows looking out onto a quiet and secluded and forest. 

The rest of the house is huge. We have a large living room, dining room and kitchen (with a new, professional grade gas range and oven), all furnished. Location is near the Lombard Gate entrance to the Presidio, close to the Marina and Pacific Heights and a short jog to the bridge or Crissy Field. There's great transport access to the city (Muni 45, 43, 41, 30x, 1, 3 and more are in walking distance) and Marin. The Presidio also has a free express bus (the PresidiGO) for residents that takes you straight to the Financial District.

Other highlights:

We know you'll like the house. More important is how you like us. You'll have five housemates to keep you company. That might sound like a lot, but it's a relaxed, social house without drama. We often cook for each other and do things together. But we all have our own lives too, and the place is at times completely empty. We believe in maintaining an even mix of guys and girls mostly in our mid-30's. 

Room is $1330 - Utilities, house cleaner, and other shared costs add an additional $200 a month.

Small room in a 3 bedroom flat perfect for a student or someone who doesn't have a lot of stuff. Victorian House is divided into 3 units and I am on the bottom floor. There are 2 units above me all with separate entrances and exits to the back yard and roof. Room has a bed, a window, 1 small but deep closet and a lockable door. There is also an electric heater. The rest of the house consists of a kitchen, pantry, living room (common area), 1 bathroom, my bedroom and office (connected, common area), and a couple of closets in the hallway. Living room is cozy with a large flat screen tv and home theater system, Playstation, tons of DVD's, record player and FAST internet. Kitchen is fully stocked with almost all the tools for cooking. Price includes PG&E, internet, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime TV, water, garbage, and monthly maid service. 

About the neighboorhood:

Located near the busiest area of Clement street. Close to Muni lines 1,2,4,38, 44 & 33. Lots of restaurants, coffee shops, grocery stores, and bars nearby. Also a very good record store and bookstore. This area of Clement is one of the best areas to live in in SF. Safe neighborhood and very lively. Weekly Farmer's market too on Sundays. 

About me: 

I'm a 44 year old male who works as an Internet Sales Manager for Porsche/Audi. I work long hours and usually have days off during the week. I do most of my activities and eating out but really enjoy spending time at home with my girlfriend as often as possible. I'm into watching movies, playing volleyball, cooking, listening to music (I have an extensive music collection), and I like to exercise at home too sometimes. I don't really party, but if I do it usually just consists of a few friends hanging out at my place to eat and drink. Nothing crazy. I also like to cook and go camping/hiking when I can.

About You:

You must be a non-smoker who respects privacy, doesn't do drugs or party too much, communicates well, cleans up after him/herself and is neat and responsible. This can be a month to month sublease. Long term may be possible if all works out.  

Please respond with a little about yourself. Name, age, work/school situation, hobbies, interests etc. Facebook link is good (here's one: https://www.facebook.com/Gomez.Rudy).

Room is available now! Rent is $1800/month + utilities; move-in is first month's rent plus $1800 deposit. No pets, no smoking. Couples ok. Minimum 1-year lease.

Room:
Available bedroom measures a spacious 11'x15' with two closets, wall-mounted flat screen TV, mounted speakers, great morning sunlight, and an en-suite bathroom with walk-in shower and recessed speakers. The room is currently set up to be rented furnished (Tempur-Pedic Cal king bed and 4 dressers) however, the room can come unfurnished without bed and dressers if preferred. Carpet, paint, lighting fixtures, floor to ceiling silk curtains, and speakers all new within last year.

House: (located on the 500 block of Nevada St, SF)
With over 2300 square feet of living space spread over 3 levels, the house offers plenty of common space for relaxing in the living room or entertaining in the large eat-in kitchen, which has a modern top-of-the-line oven, dishwasher and fridge. Sliding doors off the kitchen lead to the outdoor back patio which stays sunny most of the day, has wrap-around built in bench, large grill, gas fire pit, and lots of happy succulents. The common areas are currently furnished, although there is room in the kitchen for some items. The garage has a front loading washer and dryer, second full size refrigerator, and storage space (a bike and several boxes - no large furniture). There is a 220 charger installed in the driveway for an e-car. The house is pet-free, but very occasional visitors with well-behaved pets are permitted. We have a house cleaner 2x/month, which we split the cost of equally.

Neighborhood:
Street parking is easy to find, there is no neighborhood parking permit required, and you only need to move your car for weekly street cleaning. (There is a garage spot available - up for discussion and is negotiable). The house is a 10-minute stroll to Cortland Avenue, which has been described as a ""quaint urban village that seems forgotten by time."" The Avenue boasts a fantastic small grocery store, cafes, restaurants, bars, and unique local merchants. Bernal Heights was voted America's hottest neighborhood for 2014. The house is a 5 minute walk to the Alemany Farmer's Market (Saturdays), voted one of America's best farmer's markets by CNN. It takes just 3 minutes to get on 101 North/South and 280 North/South - super convenient for anyone commuting south. Near bus lines 23, 67, and 14. 15 minute bike ride to 24th Street BART station, or a 13-minute bike ride to the Glen Park BART station.

Housemates:
You will be joining three roommates, all young professionals in their 30s. We truly treasure our home and the harmonious co-existence we've cultivated, and we are looking for someone to join and enjoy with us! Here is what is making it work, and what we expect of you:
Guests: We enjoy having our friends over for dinner parties and BBQing on the patio when the weather is nice. We communicate plans beforehand - notice tends to match the size of the gathering. A small dinner party with notice the day before/day of is fine, while overnight guests in the living room = a message checking if this is ok a few days in advance.
Cleanliness: This is a nice house with nice things, which is wonderful, but also comes with the responsibility of keeping it that way. We take care of the place like it's our own and expect the same from you. 
Routine: We all work the good ol' 9-5(ish) - it's pretty quiet during the week, with chill vibes in the evening. 
Food: We don't have any food/kitchen restrictions. It doesn't happen often, but sometimes there's some negotiating for kitchen space/oven, because we all like cooking. We don't plan shared meals, but sometimes they happen spontaneously. 
Bills: Rent, utilities, and housecleaning dues must be paid in full and on time, no exceptions.
Humans: We are kind people : ) We take good care of the house and of each other. We like to stop and chat when we are home at the same time, find out how each other are doing, have a tea or wine, say hey I think your cupcakes are done. Our ideal roommate is another professional (or 2) who is active in the community, and conscious and committed to addressing social and environmental issues. Good communication and respectful of others is essential.",TRUE,FALSE,True,True,TRUE,True,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE

You could pay to crash in a room all by yourself/with a close buddy, or you could stay and effortlessly make friends that will last.

roommates will probably try to recruit you to work at startups and such so if that's your thing (it's not mine haha) living here could also be a great networking opportunity.

With respect to the logistics of accommodations things got a lot better. There is a ""house CEO"" to make sure absolutely everything is working and running smoothly. You likely to find comfort in knowing that if there is anything that needed to be addressed, there was someone whose job is to make sure this happens asap. This also epitomizes the entire culture of the house.

S: female, late 20s, works in finance, outgoing and active, likes to travel, cycle and ski

A: male, mid 20s, engineer, likes hang-gliding and rock climbing

We appreciate a peaceful environment at home but we also enjoy going out or inviting friends occasionally. We generally like to keep the place neat and tidy and clean up after ourselves after using the common areas. We also clean the entire house together every month so we expect our roommate to participate. Common areas come furnished but if you have things not meant for the bedroom let us know and we'll see if we can figure something out.
